const user = { 
                name: 'Piyush Agarwal!',
                logMessage()    
                { 
                    console.log(this.name); // What is logged? 
                } 
            }; setTimeout(user.logMessage, 1000);

```plaintext

After a delay of 1 second, `undefined` is logged to console. 

While `setTimeout()` function uses the `object.logMessage` as a callback, still, it invokes `object.logMessage` as a regular function, rather than a method.

And during a regular function invocation *this* equals the global object which is `window` in the case of the browser environment.

That's why `console.log(this.message)` inside `logMessage` method logs `window.message`, which is `undefined`.

How can you fix this code so that 'Piyush Agarwal!' is logged to console?
